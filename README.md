# klipper_config of a Voron V2.4

This is the config of my Voron 2.4 350mm3 Serial:V2.660

Be aware I see my config as WIP and it can and will change any time. I normally do only checkin stuff that is tested and run with the base klipper branch but I test 
also klipper PRs so it can happen that I oversee that from time to time and have stuff here that needs a special PR from klipper.

## A word of Warning:
As I have heard people tring to copy my tmc optimization.
All driver_xxx values used in tmc.cfg are optimized for the physical drivers hocked up in the different slots and the motors I use.
**Do not copy these driver_xxx values** as there could harm and worst case damage your drivers or motors

I paste that here so that people can get ideas what you can do with macros and can ideas how to solve different problems. But I do not recommand to copy any macro from here blind
without understanding what it does. 

## Disclaimer: Usage of this printer config happens at your own risk!
